0,AITA for forcing my way into my boyfriends house to get my best friends cockatoo?,4429,1ai193c,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ai193c/aita_for_forcing_my_way_into_my_boyfriends_house/,1535,"Hello all, I (24F) am very unpleased about the whole situation. My childhood best friend Libby (22F) has a red tailed black cockatoo name Carrot Cake. She’s had him since she was 5. So she is very attached to him. Only went to a community college, to just stay home and near Carrot Cake.

All of our mutual friends love Carrot Cake, so do I. We all used to just hang out at Libby’s house, mostly when we were kids just to be by Carrot Cake.

My boyfriend Lincoln (26M) loves birds. He owned a few small ones. I did tell him about Carrot Cake. He did get really intrigued and interested. He wanted to meet Carrot Cake. We only been dating for 2 months at this point and haven’t met Libby. Only a few of my other friends. 

He did ask questions. I assumed he was only intrigued, and didn’t think much of it. Libby did ask me to watch Carrot Cake, as she is visiting her grandparents in another state. I did agree. This wasn’t my first time.

Libby dropped Carrot Cake off and he’s been doing great. He’s very loving, been very active, I let him fly around. I did invite Lincoln over , as he was staying the night. He did invite his best friend Mackson. Both were playing games and doing their own thing. I was napping during the whole thing. 

Until I heard loud squatting and wings flapping like crazy. I woke up and walked into my office, to see Lincoln trying to grab Carrot Cake. Mackson was standing there just watching. It was very obvious that Carrot Cake was stressed. 

I scolded at both of them. Asking why they were in my office and why are they bothering Carrot Cake. Lincoln told me he wanted to hold Carrot Cake. I told him he is not familiar with you or Mackson, so he is scared. Lincoln tried to argue, but I told him to go in the living room. I told Mackson to leave. 

I had made sure Carrot Cake was okey, and he was. I put him in his cage and made sure to cover his cage, so he can sleep. I locked my office at this point and had the keys in my room with me. I told Lincoln not to go into my office without me. I just went back to sleep and asked Lincoln go to sleep. So we both did. 

I woke up to my boyfriend gone and my keys misplaced. I did try calling him, he didn’t answer my phone call. I went to check on Carrot Cake to see he was not there. I freaked out and just knew Lincoln had him. I called and text him until he answered. I told him to please tell me he has Carrot Cake and he did. 

I ask why and he said he wanted to watch Carrot Cake for a day. I just hung up and drove to his house. Once I got there I knocked like crazy and told him to open it. He opened a little bit, but I barged in and got Carrot Cake. Lincoln was just telling me I couldn’t barge in. I just walked by him and drove back home. 

I did tell Libby about the whole thing and she was grateful, I got Carrot Cale back safely. But also very distraught about the whole situation. 

Lincoln and his friends did message me that I couldn’t just barge into someone’s house. I feel like I did the right thing tho. AITA?

Edit: To the people saying this is AI. I get my english is not perfect. I ain’t a robot, or hope I’m not. Lol

Edit 2: I get my English is garbage. I’m sorry for over using the word “did”. ",1706981193.0
