0,AITA for not sharing a free meal with my anti-Instagram boyfriend?,13394,19c7cei,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/19c7cei/aita_for_not_sharing_a_free_meal_with_my/,1646,"I post my food pics from when I go out to eat on Instagram. It's just for fun, I spend like 30 minutes a week on it, tops. My boyfriend is a very sweet guy in many ways, but one thing that I'm not so much a fan of is that he often hops on the bandwagon of hating on innocent things. Not just not liking something, but making sure everyone knows he doesn't like it even if nobody asked. I can't help but notice a theme: Pumpkin spice lattes, pouty selfies, Taylor Swift, etc. As you can guess, he is not a fan of of the food pics and thinks it's very annoying and cringe. He doesn't even follow my insta even though he has an account :(

Even though I don't have very many followers, I have started getting occasional offers and invitations from restaurants in my city to try their food for free in exchange for a review. Nothing crazy—no steak dinners so far—but I've gotten a few sandwiches and several baked goods.

Well, I just hit the big leagues and got invited to a new restaurant opening that includes a free appetizer and entree for me and one guest. I immediately invited one of my Instagram friends who I have gone out to eat with on several occasions and who also enjoys taking food photos. I told my boyfriend and he's pissed that I'm not taking him and says I'm doing it out of spite—I really think I'm not? If the restaurant is giving me free food in exchange for a post, I'm gonna put more effort into the post and spend a few extra minutes making sure that I actually get very good shots, and I'd rather do it with someone who isn't going to sigh and roll their eyes through the whole thing. Also, I think it's pretty audacious of him to be actively unsupportive of an activity that hurts no one, but then also expects to benefit when it's actually successful.",1705855030.0
1,AITA for being pissed that my DIL won’t accommodate my allergy so I am not going to her dinner,10992,19846iq,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/19846iq/aita_for_being_pissed_that_my_dil_wont/,2229,"I am very very frustrated. My son has been married to my DIL for three years now. I have always made extra dishes that didn’t include meat to accommodate her. No matter how much it was a pain to do I always made sure she had options to eat when I hosted or she was over. She is vegetarian and at one point tried to go vegan.

My son and her never hosted due to living in a small apartment but that changed since they have just bought a home. They are having a dinner this week and I called her to remind her I am allergic to nuts. She then informed me that she doesn’t doenst have time and to bring my own food. She told me that she cooks a lot with different nuts and she can’t make adjustments to her menu.

This is where I am at be a jerk, I told her I will not be going and neither will my husband. That I have accommodated her for years and not once have I made her bring her own food. This started an argument where she thinks I am being unreasonable.

My husband is on my side but my son and her as very upset.

Edit: stop downvoting people who say there are allergies that are not life threatening, they are correct. My allergy is not life threatening, if it was going to kill me I wouldn’t be okay with any of the dishes having nuts, I just asked for one that I can eat. I can be at a table with nuts it’s fine.

This actually personally annoys me, allergic reactions are a spectrum from very mild to kill you. 

Also for everyone saying allergies get worse every time people have it are incorrect, some allergies can be improved through exposure therapy which is usually done at a doctors. My daughter has literally done that with her shellfish allergy.

2,AITA for telling my daughter she is being selfish and that she needs to take an uber since I am not leaving her older brothers wedding,10857,198zett,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/198zett/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_is_being_selfish/,2326,"This has been a built up issue, my son got married this weekend and this issue isn’t dying so I am going here. My daughter has very bad anxiety, she is 19 and I will call her Shelly. Shelly used to go to therapy when she was a minor but stopped when she turned 18. Ever since the her anxiety has been out of control, and due to this she won’t drive anymore.

She has a license but refuses to drive. We live in the USA and driving is basically needed or it’s a big inconvenience for the people around her.  Also she is an adult so it not like we can force her to drive. 

This is the issue, my son was getting married  and she was uncomfortable with so many people around at his wedding. She asked me to take her home, I told her no and if she having difficulties wait in the car. She told me it’s freezing outside and  she needs to leave. I told her no again turn on the heat in the car and wait if she needs to be away from people.

She don’t like this answer and told me she will have an attack if she stays and she needs to go home. I told her to take an Uber than I am not leaving. She don’t like this and this was turning into a full argument. Shelly told me I need take her home again and I had enough.

I told Shelly she is being selfish, that she has many opinions and I will not deprive her bother (my son) of his parents being  at his weddings. If I took her home I would miss his wedding since it was a hour drive here. She called me a jerk and left to stay in the car for a bit. She was back about an hour later for the rest of the wedding.

She has been pissed since and her younger brother is copying her",1705505933.0
3,AITA for telling my girlfriend that my loyalties lie with my baby brother?,9919,1985vkt,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1985vkt/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_my_loyalties/,2605,"My little brother recently moved in with me. It was a huge shock at first, my brother (Will, 17) is FTM. I (M34) had no idea he was trans or even questioning his gender, he always seemed perfectly happy as a girl, y'know he was very feminine presenting and all. Turns out he came out to our parents after getting his hair cut and they didn't take it well in the slightest.

From what he's told me, he wasn't exactly kicked out, they just started being unbearable. They were calling him 'Myla' in every sentence they said (just to annoy him i suppose), mum kept booking him in for appointments to get hair extensions and his lashes done, our da didn't let him wear the male uniform to sixth form and so on.

It got so bad that he literally took a train from down south to up the north to ask if he could live with me. Of course, I said yes. The house is big enough to have him live there, there's four bedrooms and an attic room.

My girlfriend (Nico, 32) was irritated when she found out. We've discussed her moving in before Will came and now she's telling me that she will not move in until Will leaves. I've explained to her that Will isn't a child we'd have to constantly supervise, that if anything he's the one making the place more liveable (he's very insistent on adding on to the home decor and so on, as well as being better than me at cleaning.), and that the house is large enough to still have privacy even with him around.

Nico's argued that it's not truly 'ours' if Will is always there, that we won't be able to start trying to concieve, that she's not willing to live with a 'hormonal and rebellious' teenager and that she's just flat out uncomfortable with Will being near her and living with her and her son (M10) in the same home.

Ultimately, I've told her that my loyalties lie with my baby brother, who is homeless and vulnerable, unlike the grown woman with a good paying job and a home of her own. She's called my mum up to complain about it and she's said that i was in the wrong for prioritizing Will, and Will himself said that he doesn't want to be 'causing problems' in my relationship.

4,AITA for telling my BIL to pay me $700 for my lost coat when I bought it for $100?,8511,1982aoy,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1982aoy/aita_for_telling_my_bil_to_pay_me_700_for_my_lost/,4253,"Last year I was at the mall with my fiance when I saw this awesome cashmere/wool coat. It was perfect in every way and there was only 1 left in my size. The best news was that it was on clearance for $100 so I bought it without a second thought. I have worn it several times last year but it hasn’t been cold enough this year for me to break out the coat. Last week when I saw the news about the upcoming cold front, I decided it was time to take it to the dry cleaners so that I can wear it this week.

After tearing all my closets apart without seeing it, I asked my fiance if she had seen it. She told me that she haven’t seen me wear it in awhile so she lent it to her brother to wear to a wedding. I was annoyed at hearing this but decided not to make a big deal so I simply told her to tell her brother to bring it back so I could get it dry cleaned. Thursday rolls around and he hasn’t brought it back so I asked her about it again, nothing. Come Friday, and i haven’t heard anything so I called him. He said that he told my wife on Tuesday that he got drunk at the wedding and lost my coat. I was super annoyed at this so I told him he owes that exact coat from that exact brand.

Last night my fiance came home from work in a mood and handed me $100. She said that her brother dropped off the money and I shouldn’t have made her brother pay for the coat since I knew he doesn’t make very much and I haven’t worn it but a handful of times. I looked at the $100 and told her I wanted a replacement coat or the amount it currently cost so that I can buy a new one and that $100 won’t cover it. She said he went to the store and it cost $700 now but she knew I only paid $100 for it so she told him $100 would cover the cost. I argued that $100 doesn’t buy me a new coat. We went back and forth but couldn’t find any common ground. She offered to throw in an extra $100 of her own money and said sarcastically that I’m coming out ahead. I argued that I’m still out a coat and nothing will satisfy my lost except for a replacement coat. She argued that I don’t have to have the exact coat and that I can buy a similar one with $200.

She thought I was being ridiculous and called her parents on speaker phone. Of course they sided with their children and her dad tried to say that a man shouldn’t be so hung up on a coat. I told him that a man replaces what he loses. So now they’re all mad at me for wanting to make a profit from their son and intimating that he’s not a man.

Am I wrong for wanting the same coat as a replacement?",1705409819.0
5,AITA for banning my husband's sister from my house until she uses the names of my twins,8375,198ke93,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/198ke93/aita_for_banning_my_husbands_sister_from_my_house/,1915,"I (38f) am married with 2 children, twins Amy and Nina (6f). We live in the same town as most of his families in the house I inherited from my grandfather. It is the biggest house in the family so we often host family gatherings.  
  
My husband’s youngest sister Jane (31f) has been traveling for work ever since her early 20’s. Mid 2022 she moved in with her fiancé about half a hour drive away from us. After that Jane shows up regularly at family gatherings and rebuilds relationships with her family members. The only thing she never bothers to do is address my daughters by their names.  
  
Amy and Nina are identical twins. I understand when people refer to them as “the twins” but I think it is important that their individuality is respected. I always tell family and friends that now that they are 6 years old it is important for them to have their own identity and if possible please treat them as individual rather than a pair or a unit. My girls have different interests and hair/dressing styles so it is not hard to tell them apart.  
  
Jane always insists on calling the girls “the twins” and makes no effort to distinguish them. I asked her many times to treat them as individuals, like her other nieces and nephews, and Jane would say OK and then keep doing the same thing.  
  
Last Christmas Amy made paper cranes and Nina painted flower pictures as their Christmas gifts to everyone in the family. They signed their names and individually handed the gift to everyone. Jane’s fiancé had to work this year and did not join us so after brunch she video called him in the living room while the rest of us did our things nearby. Her fiancé saw the crane in her hand and asked where she got it and Jane said “Oh, one of the twins gave it to me for Christmas. The other twin drew some flowers.”  
  
I felt that this was a disrespect as my girls put a lot of effort into the gifts and deserve to have their private dedication recognized. When everyone left, I told Jane I expected her to call my girls Amy and Nina from now on and to treat them like individual and know their differences. Jane said that she won’t bother as my girls are too young. So I told her she is banned from my house until she learns how to address my girls by their names. Jane just stomped off. My husband agreed with me on this.  
  
A few days ago my MIL called to plan my husband’s birthday in early February. I told her we could have the party at my house like usual but Jane would not be invited. My MIL was alarmed and asked why and when she learned of what happened she was mad at Jane. Jane called me a few hours ago calling me AH for making a big deal out of something insignificant. She said my girls would be known as the twins whether I like it or not and once they get older people WILL recognize them as individuals but not now when they’re young and “just another couple of girls.” She said she deserves to be with her family for her brother’s birthday and I need to let it go.

6,AITA for telling my husband I will move back in once my stepdaughter and her family move out.,7887,197zih8,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/197zih8/aita_for_telling_my_husband_i_will_move_back_in/,893,"I married my husband when his daughter, Trudi, was 22, she is now 36. He was 47 and I was 32. I have two kids, 20 and 18 now. Both are away at college. 

Trudi never liked me and that was fine. She has a mother and she was a full adult living on her own when we met. Her parents had been divorced for six years when I met her father. 

We live in a city with lots of tourism so it was an easy decision to keep my apartment and do short term rentals when my kids and I moved in with my husband. We also use it for out of town guests. 

Trudi and her husband ran into some financial problems last year. Trudi and her family of four moved in with us. We agreed that after the holidays I would stop taking reservations for my apartment and they could move in there. They would sign a lease and we would ""rent"" it to them without collecting rent so they could build up rental history and money. 

Trudi moved in last October. It was hell. She doesn't help around the house and neither do her kids. Her husband is working his ass off to get money together for them so he comes home exhausted. And he is more help than her or their kids. The three of them leave dirty dishes everywhere. Dirty laundry everywhere. The house is just a mess. I have spoken to all of them, including my husband about this. My son-in-law is the only one who makes an effort. Trudi literally said that I live in her father's house so I don't get to tell her what to do. My husband did not back me up. 

So I moved out. My apartment is now empty since the holidays are over. I said I didn't want them treating my property like they were treating my husband's home. 

They are all mad at me for leaving and changing the plan. She actually threatened to sue me since they have a signed lease. I told her to go ahead since I could prove that I never got the agreed upon deposit or first and last month's rent. (Which we were going to ""cover"" to help them start over). 

I've been here for a week now and it is great. No noise, no mess, a much better commute for me to my work. My husband has been spending a few nights a week here with me. He wants me to come home and give them the apartment like we agreed. I said I would do that if we went back to his house that minute and it was in good shape. 

Narrators voice over goes here ""it was not"".  It was disgusting. Like it smelled bad. It was like if five teenage boys were living there with no supervision. 

She saw me looking around in disgust and said that it wasn't her fault and that the mess was because they didn't have their own living space. Yeah sure. I turned around and went back to my place. 

I offered to let my husband move in with me if he wants them to have their own space. He won't because he is retired and likes where he is. 

So like I said they are all mad at me. My husband, Trudi, her kids. Trudi's husband is the only one who understands my position. I will no longer agree to let them in my apartment at I will also only move back once they leave.",1705399760.0
7,AITA for telling my in-laws that if they want a grandchild they should give my wife her inheritance now.,7361,19bm2sk,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/19bm2sk/aita_for_telling_my_inlaws_that_if_they_want_a/,1027,"Basically my in-laws want their only child, my wife Diana, to start pumping out grandchildren. 

Diana is 28 and just finishing her PhD. Then she wants to get established in a career before we start a family. 

My in-laws know how much money I make and they know we could live comfortably off my earnings. That isn't what Diana wants. She has worked her ass off to get where she is and she wants to reap the rewards of here hard work. She also says that once she is working then I can cut back on my hours I'm a welder, and relax a little. I have been working since I was 15, so literally half my life. I make a very good living in return for a lot of fairly hard work. I have supported Diana and her education. She will graduate without student loans. We have a house. She has a good car. We have a good life. We want a few more years alone before we start our family. 

Over Christmas the in-laws just wouldn't drop it. I finally snapped. I said that if they wanted grandchildren then they could reimburse us for her education. They could further pay her the salary she would be giving up. When she returned to work they could pay her the difference between what she could be earning and her entry level position. They could pay for a nanny so my wife could work. 

Or they could back off and wait for us to be ready. 

They said that they couldn't afford all that. I asked them how they expected us to afford it. I said that if it was really what they wanted they could just give her the inheritance that would be coming her way now instead of later. 

They got all offended and said that is not hers until they don't need it any more. 

Diana asked me to drop it. She has tried dozens of times to explain to her parents why we are waiting. They just ignore her. They ignore what we want for our lives. 

They have been very cold since Christmas. They seem to think I was a rude asshole for pointing out the costs of what they are asking for. A lot of her family agree with them that I went too far in asking them to pay if they want a grandchild now instead of later.",1705785218.0
8,AITA for not telling my dad’s guests that I marinated the chicken with milk?,6902,199hw0i,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/199hw0i/aita_for_not_telling_my_dads_guests_that_i/,1150,"It was my(18m) dad(43)’s birthday.

A couple of them were surprised that I managed to cook roasted chicken well. I told them ‘Thanks. I just marinate it with milk to make it tender’ and one of them panicked. 

Turns out he has milk allergy and gets digestive issues. My dad started berating me, saying I should have told them ahead of time that I was using milk to check if anyone is allergic. That it was careless of me not to check first when milk is a common allergy.

UPDATE : Talked to the guy about it. I told him I’m sorry I didn’t ask first and he said it’s his fault for not telling me. He then assured that he didn’t get any reaction, and that milk only makes him ‘gassy.’ He said it’s actually him being lactose intolerant but that he sometimes say allergy instead.",1705553322.0
9,AITA for refusing to hand over my college fund for my little sister's surgery?,6815,19c2wbv,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/19c2wbv/aita_for_refusing_to_hand_over_my_college_fund/,2470,"I (17M) am the oldest kid in my family. My parents have two bio kids; me and my 12 year old sister and they adopted my 4 other siblings. I had dozens of foster siblings over the years as well. My parents have struggled to make time and have the money for all of us. It has meant a lot of sacrificing and mostly on my part. My parents were able to make sure all my younger siblings had at least one activity outside of school to do but they never did that for me. I was forced to play football when I was 5 but by the time I was 7 my parents had started fostering and I was no longer doing that. My siblings all get to do something they like. Cora does dance for example. Some of my other siblings are in music classes.

The younger kids were also prioritized with school field trips. So they always got to go while I haven't since I was 6. The last time I asked was when I was about 9 and my parents told me to work for the money to pay. My grandparents found out what they said and gave me the money and my parents took it off me to use for the household. My grandparents were so mad at  them for that.

They delayed my tonsil surgery by 2 years because they prioritized 2 foster kids and two of my siblings surgeries over mine.

My grandparents saw how much I was getting the short end of everything with my parents and they set up a college fund for me. It's a lot of money and really caught me off guard. My parents know about it but cannot access it. They only know because of a fight with my grandparents over the lack of saving for my future when they have saved something for my siblings. My parents said the money my grandparents saved should be divided equally because $350,000 is a lot to save for one grandchild when you have multiple.

That money is still there and I have plans for it. But my youngest sister is 5 and she needs a pretty major stomach surgery. She's had a lot of health troubles since her birth and my parents have paid a lot of money on her medical expenses. They were told this surgery could turn her life around and give her a chance at living with less pain and stomach complications. It could give her a more normal childhood because she can't do a lot. They don't have the money for the surgery and they want me to give them the money to pay for it and for the expenses afterward. They said they need $270,000 for the whole thing and maybe they can give some of it back but they might need even more if stuff gets more complicated. I told them they can't have that money and they lost it and told me I was being selfish and I argued back that they take from me all the time. I asked why they didn't take the money they saved for all my siblings and use that, why does it have to be mine. They said I am putting college before my sister's future and accused me of being unwilling because she's my sister through adoption and not my bio sister.
