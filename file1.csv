0,AITA for not sharing a free meal with my anti-Instagram boyfriend?,14916,19c7cei,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/19c7cei/aita_for_not_sharing_a_free_meal_with_my/,1766,"I post my food pics from when I go out to eat on Instagram. It's just for fun, I spend like 30 minutes a week on it, tops. My boyfriend is a very sweet guy in many ways, but one thing that I'm not so much a fan of is that he often hops on the bandwagon of hating on innocent things. Not just not liking something, but making sure everyone knows he doesn't like it even if nobody asked. I can't help but notice a theme: Pumpkin spice lattes, pouty selfies, Taylor Swift, etc. As you can guess, he is not a fan of of the food pics and thinks it's very annoying and cringe. He doesn't even follow my insta even though he has an account :(

Even though I don't have very many followers, I have started getting occasional offers and invitations from restaurants in my city to try their food for free in exchange for a review. Nothing crazy—no steak dinners so far—but I've gotten a few sandwiches and several baked goods.

Well, I just hit the big leagues and got invited to a new restaurant opening that includes a free appetizer and entree for me and one guest. I immediately invited one of my Instagram friends who I have gone out to eat with on several occasions and who also enjoys taking food photos. I told my boyfriend and he's pissed that I'm not taking him and says I'm doing it out of spite—I really think I'm not? If the restaurant is giving me free food in exchange for a post, I'm gonna put more effort into the post and spend a few extra minutes making sure that I actually get very good shots, and I'd rather do it with someone who isn't going to sigh and roll their eyes through the whole thing. Also, I think it's pretty audacious of him to be actively unsupportive of an activity that hurts no one, but then also expects to benefit when it's actually successful.",1705855030.0
1,AITA for telling my in-laws that if they want a grandchild they should give my wife her inheritance now.,7630,19bm2sk,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/19bm2sk/aita_for_telling_my_inlaws_that_if_they_want_a/,1079,"Basically my in-laws want their only child, my wife Diana, to start pumping out grandchildren. 

Diana is 28 and just finishing her PhD. Then she wants to get established in a career before we start a family. 

My in-laws know how much money I make and they know we could live comfortably off my earnings. That isn't what Diana wants. She has worked her ass off to get where she is and she wants to reap the rewards of here hard work. She also says that once she is working then I can cut back on my hours I'm a welder, and relax a little. I have been working since I was 15, so literally half my life. I make a very good living in return for a lot of fairly hard work. I have supported Diana and her education. She will graduate without student loans. We have a house. She has a good car. We have a good life. We want a few more years alone before we start our family. 

Over Christmas the in-laws just wouldn't drop it. I finally snapped. I said that if they wanted grandchildren then they could reimburse us for her education. They could further pay her the salary she would be giving up. When she returned to work they could pay her the difference between what she could be earning and her entry level position. They could pay for a nanny so my wife could work. 

Or they could back off and wait for us to be ready. 

They said that they couldn't afford all that. I asked them how they expected us to afford it. I said that if it was really what they wanted they could just give her the inheritance that would be coming her way now instead of later. 

They got all offended and said that is not hers until they don't need it any more. 

Diana asked me to drop it. She has tried dozens of times to explain to her parents why we are waiting. They just ignore her. They ignore what we want for our lives. 

They have been very cold since Christmas. They seem to think I was a rude asshole for pointing out the costs of what they are asking for. A lot of her family agree with them that I went too far in asking them to pay if they want a grandchild now instead of later.",1705785218.0
2,AITA for making my wife pay me for something she gave away,7295,19cfu8x,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/19cfu8x/aita_for_making_my_wife_pay_me_for_something_she/,2627,"My wife has a bad habit of giving away or lending out things that don’t belong to her. I’ve lost count of how many times I go to look for something of mine only for her to say she lent it to somebody. She also takes forever to get the item back, she once lent my stuff  to a coworker and refused to ask for it back for a month. And I’ll never forget the day my usually quiet, reserved son snapped at her for trying to give away his Nintendo switch. If I wasn’t also fed up with her behavior I would have washed his mouth out with soap. I’ve had countless talks with her but she continues to do this. My son and I have resorted to locking up anything we didn’t want touched which is something we shouldn’t have to do in our own home. 

Last week I won a $300 tent in a raffle. I had no plans on using it so I was selling it. When I found a buyer and went to look for it I couldn’t find it. When I asked my wife she said she gave it to a friend of ours. I got mad at her and said she had no right to give it away. Her defense was since I didn’t spend money on it and was i planning on using it, it made sense to give it away for free. I told her that wasn’t her decision to make but she just kept repeating herself. 

I had enough of this and said she’s either going to pay me herself or get the money from who she gave it to, and if she didn’t I’d get law enforcement involved. Since she rather die than ask a friend for money she paid me out of her own pocket. 

This issue eventually got around to her family. While they did say she should have talked to me first they also reprimanded me for asking for payment. They reasoned that since I didn’t actually buy the tent I didn’t loose any money and it went to a friend who could actually put it to good use. I got several text saying I should be ashamed for extorting my wife for money. I think I have every right to want to be paid for something of mines that was taken but every one keeps emphasizing the fact that I didn’t technically buy the tent and didn’t want it so I have nothing to be upset about.

3,AITA for refusing to hand over my college fund for my little sister's surgery?,7245,19c2wbv,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/19c2wbv/aita_for_refusing_to_hand_over_my_college_fund/,2608,"I (17M) am the oldest kid in my family. My parents have two bio kids; me and my 12 year old sister and they adopted my 4 other siblings. I had dozens of foster siblings over the years as well. My parents have struggled to make time and have the money for all of us. It has meant a lot of sacrificing and mostly on my part. My parents were able to make sure all my younger siblings had at least one activity outside of school to do but they never did that for me. I was forced to play football when I was 5 but by the time I was 7 my parents had started fostering and I was no longer doing that. My siblings all get to do something they like. Cora does dance for example. Some of my other siblings are in music classes.

The younger kids were also prioritized with school field trips. So they always got to go while I haven't since I was 6. The last time I asked was when I was about 9 and my parents told me to work for the money to pay. My grandparents found out what they said and gave me the money and my parents took it off me to use for the household. My grandparents were so mad at  them for that.

They delayed my tonsil surgery by 2 years because they prioritized 2 foster kids and two of my siblings surgeries over mine.

My grandparents saw how much I was getting the short end of everything with my parents and they set up a college fund for me. It's a lot of money and really caught me off guard. My parents know about it but cannot access it. They only know because of a fight with my grandparents over the lack of saving for my future when they have saved something for my siblings. My parents said the money my grandparents saved should be divided equally because $350,000 is a lot to save for one grandchild when you have multiple.

That money is still there and I have plans for it. But my youngest sister is 5 and she needs a pretty major stomach surgery. She's had a lot of health troubles since her birth and my parents have paid a lot of money on her medical expenses. They were told this surgery could turn her life around and give her a chance at living with less pain and stomach complications. It could give her a more normal childhood because she can't do a lot. They don't have the money for the surgery and they want me to give them the money to pay for it and for the expenses afterward. They said they need $270,000 for the whole thing and maybe they can give some of it back but they might need even more if stuff gets more complicated. I told them they can't have that money and they lost it and told me I was being selfish and I argued back that they take from me all the time. I asked why they didn't take the money they saved for all my siblings and use that, why does it have to be mine. They said I am putting college before my sister's future and accused me of being unwilling because she's my sister through adoption and not my bio sister.

4,AITA for not telling my dad’s guests that I marinated the chicken with milk?,7018,199hw0i,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/199hw0i/aita_for_not_telling_my_dads_guests_that_i/,1152,"It was my(18m) dad(43)’s birthday. He wanted me to cook for him and some friends, and I said yes. Met some of them before. One of his friends is also my gf(18)’s dad. I did what my mom taught me : use milk to make the chicken tender.

A couple of them were surprised that I managed to cook roasted chicken well. I told them ‘Thanks. I just marinate it with milk to make it tender’ and one of them panicked. 

Turns out he has milk allergy and gets digestive issues. My dad started berating me, saying I should have told them ahead of time that I was using milk to check if anyone is allergic. That it was careless of me not to check first when milk is a common allergy.

UPDATE : Talked to the guy about it. I told him I’m sorry I didn’t ask first and he said it’s his fault for not telling me. He then assured that he didn’t get any reaction, and that milk only makes him ‘gassy.’ He said it’s actually him being lactose intolerant but that he sometimes say allergy instead.",1705553322.0
5,AITA for suggesting my friend go back to therapy after how she reacted in a Chinese Restaurant?,6440,19aexik,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/19aexik/aita_for_suggesting_my_friend_go_back_to_therapy/,707,"So yesterday, me (28F), Jess (27F) and 3 other friends (mid to late 20sF) went to a Chinese restaurant. I’m Chinese, Jess is half Japanese/Chinese and the rest of my friendship group are Asian, if that’s relevant.

For context, Jess unfortunately was victim to a verbal racist attack when covid first started. It was such an awful thing to happen and I’m still mad it happened. The incident traumatised her quite badly and she went to therapy for a couple of years.

We are getting seated and there is a Caucasian man with his son (maybe 6-8 years old). They smile at me and I smile back. Anyway, our food comes and the kid is curious and I can hear him asking his dad “what are those ladies eating?”.

The dad happily explains to his son the different kinds of seafood (like pipis), and pork belly and noodle dishes we were eating. It was really clear that they weren’t making fun of the food or us, and honestly I thought it was cute that the kid was interested. But Jess started getting agitated. I asked her what was up and she said she didn’t like that they were talking about us. Me and my friend tried to just say they were just talking about the food we were eating. Unexpectedly (as Jess is quite shy), she stood up and said to the dad, “this isn’t a zoo, you know?”. Then she walked out and some of us followed her out and me and another friend apologised to the man and kid who were really shocked. 

Outside m, we were trying to console Jess. She was adamant that the man was teaching his kid to be racist but we were all trying to tell her it wasn’t like that, and she said we were invalidating her. This went back and forth with us trying to say that the man and kid weren’t being racist. Finally, in my effort to try help, I suggested maybe Jess should go back to therapy. 

Jess gave me a really dirty look, called me a shit friend and left. A couple of my friends, although acknowledging that the way Jess reacted to the man and kid was abnormal, told me it wasn’t my place to suggest that, but my other friend said that I wasn’t wrong and as her friend who cares about her well-being, I had a right to suggest that. 

Jess and I have been friends since high school and I spent a great deal of time supporting her after the racist incident.

AITA?

——————

UPDATE AND EDIT: Thanks everyone for your replies. For those asking what happened, essentially a group of men approached and surrounded her at a train station, shouting racists comments at her. If someone hadn’t intervened, she would have very likely been bashed or SAed. 

For those saying I should drop her as a friend, we’ve had a friendship that’s lasted nearly 15 years. I’m not going to give up on her because of an incident like this - and she honestly has never done anything like this before. She needs support and when the incident occurred I didn’t know how to appropriately handle it.

Thank you everyone for your advice about it being wrong timing. Upon reflection and talking with my friends, we realised that none of us saw the signs early enough during that dinner that she was in crisis. We should have seen it when she started getting agitated inside the restaurant and perhaps taken her outside for a moment instead of dismissing her. None of us are really equipped to deal with someone in mental crisis and we are considering going to mental health first aid.

Finally, I tried to call and then message Jess and apologise but she did not reply. However, her mum did call me today (I did not message her mum) and told me that Jess felt really bad about what happened and wanted to apologise to me and my friends. Jess also said she didn’t mean what she said about me being a bad friend and she was having a panic attack at the time. Jess isn’t feeling ready to talk to us yet and would rather her family support her for now until she’s feeling better. In the meantime, we will be sending chocolates and self care items.

6,AITA for not including my son's adopted child in my will?,5755,199w5qe,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/199w5qe/aita_for_not_including_my_sons_adopted_child_in/,4551,"My wife and I are in our sixties, we are thinking of retiring soon and we are trying to get our finances and everything we own in order. For example we're finally selling our old house because it's too big and we don't need it, we want to live in a quieter place and a smaller house. 

We have three kids, all adults by now. Each of our kids have their own kids as well. We have a daughter with one kid, a son with two and another son with two biological kids and a stepdaughter.

Our youngest son was married, about ten or so years ago he cheated on his wife and they got divorced. He cheated with his current wife, then he adopted her daughter. 

We want to divide our state between our children and our grandchildren. We had a family gathering to talk about some of these things, especially the house in case any of our children wanted to buy it themselves. 

Our son got very angry when he heard that we're cutting off his adopted child from the will. We told him she's not our family and we don't support his life choices and how he ruined his family. He told us to stop holding a grudge for something that happened years ago and accept the child, or cut him and his family off. My wife and I think that his new wife and the child are living proof of him ruining his family. Do you think we are wrong in this? She is a child and he's right that she's ""his"", but does that automatically makes her our family? He said we're treating his wife and daughter poorly and we're acting like assholes towards a kid.


The step daughter and the adopted daughter are the same girl. My son married her mother and then adopted her.

Questions: 

The girl was 1 or 2 years old when my son and his mother started their relationship.

We don't see or talk to each other often, only in family gatherings. They live in another state. She doesn't call us her grandparents.

What each of our kids is getting are family heirlooms and not money. All the money will be distributed between our grandkids in our will to hopefully help them get their education paid. 

My son doesn't have contact with his ex wife or his biological kids, he cut them off and didn't even want to pay child support. My wife and I helped our daughter in law and our grandchildren. 

To make it clear. What my son is getting from us is some photos and items from his childhood that we keep. It's essentially ""trash"" but we like to look at them every once in a while to remember our kid's childhoods. He isn't getting money or jewellery 

I'm getting a lot of comments, sorry if I can't answer all the questions.

For those who wonder if the girl could actually be biologically my son's daughter, i don't know and it doesn't make a difference to me or my wife.

For those who say that love should be unconditional, I disagree. Love is always conditional to the bare minimum to maintain a bond, that's my opinion. 

Yes, my son's two biological kids (the kids he had with his first wife) are in the will along with our two other kids' children. 

Our grandchildren are getting some heirlooms too, the things we're giving to our son aren't things that our other two kids would want.

For those who are saying that I would neglect a child adopted by my children under different circumstances, no. This is all about the circumstances in which this girl and my son's new wife came into the family. I don't care if she's adopted or biological, it'll be the same for me. The circumstances in which my son cheated (which is bad enough) and proceeded to kick his family out and abandon them are the reason why neither my wife, me or the rest of our family has a good relationship with the three of them.

My two other kids agree with us and aren't close to their brother either. ",1705600515.0

9,AITA for not letting my sister use my promdress that I paid for?,5484,19cqxwf,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/19cqxwf/aita_for_not_letting_my_sister_use_my_promdress/,888,"So, I know it might seem a bit stupid, but its important to me. It is currently a argument with my family. I(25, F) had my prom in 2017 and I bought my entire prom outfit for myself due to my family not having the best economy and I saved for over a year to be able to buy my dream dress and jewelry(everything in total about $300, which is a lot for us). I had an amazing time and that dress is very important to me since I have never had the best self confidence and it made me feel beautiful.

&#x200B;

Now my sister(18, F, lets call her Annie) is having her prom later this year and she asked if she could use my dress as well. She loves it and wished to use it. I told her that I would prefer if she didnt since it is so important to me(I also have a nero disorder and it makes it hard for me to let other people use my things) and she said okay and said she at least wanted to ask, but she was fine with finding another dress and I said Id help pay if she wanted (and if she wanted, she was welcome to use the jewellry, she will wear the hair accessories) I am pretty stable in income. Annie thanked me and said we could go shopping together.

Now, I live about three hours away from my family due to school and I dont go home often due to not having a car. I came home last week to visit as my nephews(cousins kids, shes like a sister) are getting baptised. When I walk through the front door to my parents house, Annie is wearing my prom dress and my grandma and mom are taking messurments. I ask them what they are doing and they said that I'm being am AH for not letting Annie use it. She is my ""baby sister"" after all(moms words). I got upset and screamed at Annie to take it off, which I later apologised for, she believed I changed my mind since mom said I had agreed. I yelled at my mom and grandma because they tried to go behind my back and even change the dress to better fit Annie, she is 155lbs, I was almost 300lbs when I wore it. I cried and yelled at them. As soon as Annie came back with my dress, I took it and packed it down, saying I'd stay with my cousin.

Now my family is torn. Some people agreeing with me and some saying Im an AH for not letting Annie use it. I dont feel like I was in the wrong for not letting her use it, after all it was all my dress that I payed for and I even offered to pay for her dress.

So AITA?

EDIT: Since a lot of people have mentioned not wearing it again. I have worn it since. It's not the typical ""prom dress"", its more a flowy summer dress

Also, the reason I didn't bring it with me is because I live in a dorm room and I could only bring the essentials with me. Once I move to a bigger place, I planned on bringing all my stuff to my new place. The dress is currently at my cousins place and I might bring it back with me when I go home.

Please don't blame my sister for this. Her and I have talked it out and we're on good terms. We will buy a dress together once her prom gets closer(May)",1705911731.0
