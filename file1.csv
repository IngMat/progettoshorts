0,AITA for saying “you should’ve thought about that before you procreated”?,13164,1agotpu,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1agotpu/aita_for_saying_you_shouldve_thought_about_that/,1001,"My ex and I have a 13 year old daughter, “Nicole”. Nicole has several medical conditions that require a lot of attention. She will need some sort of in home assistance for the rest of her life. While we have an aide to help a couple of days a week, it is still a challenge. The outcome of Nicole’s condition became clear when she was 2. At that point, my ex and I agreed we wouldn’t have more kids because it wouldn’t be fair to anyone. There’d be no way we could focus attention on two kids. Someone would lose out in this situation.

We divorced when Nicole was 5. We originally had 50/50 custody. 3 years later, my ex remarried. His new wife, Callie, is nice. My ex did say that she didn’t understand the severity of Nicole’s condition . I figured there was a learning curve. Eventually, Callie basically said she wanted to be hands off. Which I respected, though I wondered how it’d work considering Nicole lives with them half the time. 

Last year, my ex and Callie had a baby. I was a little surprised given my ex was always firm on not having more kids but figured it wasn’t any of my business. He did begin to complain that it was a lot of work juggling Nicole and the baby. I sympathized but really didn’t know what else to say.

Recently, the venting got worse. He said Callie yelled at him for taking Nicole to her physical therapy appointment instead of helping her with the baby. He brought up potentially having Nicole stay with me more. I wasn’t entirely shocked but it pissed me off. I said Nicole was his daughter. He can’t just abandon that responsibility. He asked what he was supposed to do about the baby. 

I said “maybe you should’ve thought of that before you procreated? I mean, really, we discussed this 10 years ago as to why it’d be hard to juggle two kids. Why did you think having another would be a good idea?” He got quiet and said Callie wanted a baby. I said that isn’t enough of a reason and maybe he should’ve thought harder before bringing more life into this world. 

The conversation ended with me saying I’d call my lawyer and we could arrange for him to have less custody as I’d rather my daughter be properly cared for than be viewed as a burden.

Callie called me that night very upset that I had made my ex cry and that I said her baby shouldn’t exist. I said that’s not what I said completely, more that they didn’t think it through. She called me a jerk.
