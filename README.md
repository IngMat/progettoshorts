CURRENTLY NOT WORKING BECAUSE CHATGPT NO LONGER PROVIDES FREE TOKENS FOR THE API

Using Python, this project completely automated creating, editing and publishing 60 second vertical videos.
It uses the highest rated daily posts from Reddit's most popular communities as a starting place;
through the use of AI it generates custom TTS (Text to speech), video titles and thumbnails,
while also adding a video background and music. It then uses YouTube's API to automatically upload the finished video.

HOW TO INSTALL:

git clone https://github.com/Wxlddd/progettoshorts.git
